## Notes

### Javascript:
- Prototype somewhat makes sense. I'm going to need to revisit this later.
-- I think I get what they do, but I'm not entirely sure why you'd use them.
-- I can see using them if you're importing a library, but if you have access to the object itself, why would you need to use prototype?


### Racket
- Tutorial boolean output shows 'false' while mine shows '#false'
- If statements feel a lot like ternary operators in javascript
